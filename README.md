## Credits

I would like to credit countless YouTube videos that showed examples of this program. Each have conceptually show file management and the various ways to tackle this program (excluding the ones using mySQL workbech). I can't get update employee to function correctly, and I would like to tackle the bonuses; however, a project is approaching soon. I will have to revisit this program at a later date.
